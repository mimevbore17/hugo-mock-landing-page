<h3 id="illustrated-features--user-stories">Illustrated Features + User Stories</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As a beginner developer, I want to see a simple example in Python when reading about a function, so that I can better understand how to use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As an experienced developer, I want to quickly convert a JavaScript example into TypeScript, so that I can use it in my project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a student, I want to get beginner-level examples when reading complex documentation, so that I can understand foundational concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a developer working across languages, I want to request examples in a different programming language, so that I can apply them to my current tech stack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a time-constrained engineer, I want to generate examples in one click, so that I don’t need to leave the documentation page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a frontend developer, I want to generate browser-compatible examples for different environments (e.g., Chrome, Safari), so that I can ensure cross-browser support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a technical writer, I want to preview AI-generated code snippets based on my draft documentation, so that I can include more accurate examples in the final version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a developer learning a new framework, I want to get intermediate examples that build on basic concepts, so that I can gradually increase my understanding without being overwhelmed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a developer working with APIs, I want to auto-generate examples showing how to call specific endpoints, so that I can test them quickly in tools like Postman or fetch-based scripts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a team lead, I want my team members to be able to generate standardized code examples with predefined complexity and style, so that our codebase stays consistent during onboarding and documentation review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a developer contributing to open source, I want to generate alternative examples for existing documentation sections, so that I can improve inclusivity for users from diverse programming backgrounds without infinitely creating documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a developer transitioning into a new domain (e.g., from web dev to data science), I want to see domain-specific examples based on the same concept, so that I can transfer knowledge across disciplines more easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a developer questioning best practices, I want the extension to generate both “standard” and “opinionated” examples (i.e. more complex ones that reveal implementation structure more), so that I can compare trade-offs and make informed design choices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a developer mentoring juniors, I want them to generate progressively challenging examples for the same function or concept, so that they can use them as self-teaching material without creating everything from scratch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a software architect, I want to generate examples that are more complex and follow specific architectural patterns (e.g., MVC, MVVM).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Could support a “hover-to-preview” feature for snippets to avoid cluttering the page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initial scoping will focus on major documentation sites (e.g., MDN, React, Python Docs).1</p>
</li>
</ul>
