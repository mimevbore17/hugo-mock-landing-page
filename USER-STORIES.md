This is a backlog of user stories for SquadSync, an application that enables coaches and players to find and plan their next soccer games more efficiently. These user stories reflect both currently implemented features and planned enhancements.

## Current Features

These are features that are currently implemented in SquadSync and featured on the landing page.

### Illustrated Features

1. As a soccer player, I am always looking for a game and want to be able to specify the type of game I want to play in

2. As a coach, I want to ensure that I can bring my team to a field that is guaranteed to be open and available during practice time

3. As a new player, I want to ensure that I can play games with people around my same skill level, so that the game is still fun and enjoyable

### Other Features

1. As a coach, I want to see in real-time who can and who cannot come to the games, so that I may plan my gameplan accordingly

2. As a manager, I want a simple and easy way to make sure that the refs are getting paid without having to chase each player for their portion

3. As an international player, I want to be able to play and communicate with anybody, with my language not being a barrier

## Potential Feature Expansion

1. As a player, I want to set notification preferences for specific game types and locations, so I never miss an opportunity to join matches that fit my interests.
2. As a team captain, I want to rate players' performance after games, so future captains can make informed decisions when balancing teams.
3. As a field owner, I want to post my field's availability schedule and set hourly rates, so local teams can easily book and pay for time slots.
4. As a substitute player, I want to join a waitlist for full games and receive instant notifications when spots open up, so I can quickly claim available positions.
5. As a regular player, I want to save my preferred positions and skill level in my profile, so I don't have to re-enter this information for each new game I join.
6. As a game organizer, I want to track attendance history of players, so I can prioritize reliable participants for future matches.
7. As a player, I want to share my post-game location for social gatherings, so teammates can easily join for post-match celebrations or discussions.
8. As a field booker, I want to see historical weather patterns for specific time slots, so I can make informed decisions about scheduling outdoor games.
9. As a team member, I want to upload and share game photos with match participants only, so we can maintain a private collection of our games together.
